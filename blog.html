	<h1>Hunting Day 1</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3> A 12 gauge shot gun a chocalte lab named coco and good friends and family. With all that plus shelter and food we were all prepared for a good hunting season.
	When we first came onto the praire we russled up a good hundred pheasants. Later on in the evening we came back to the house with about 20 birds.</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog2">
	
	
	<h1> Hunting Day 2</h1>
	<h2>Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>On the second day instead of driving to the opposite side to sneak we spanned the feild. Which means we formed a chain with us and the dogs and slowly pushed forward.
	After the first wave we circled around the end man and went back, with about 15-25 pheasants.</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog3">
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 3</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>On the third day we decided to search for new land. Near the evening we found a man in 1990 Chevy pickup and couldn't get it's top off.
	My father and me assited him and in return he gave us access to over 500 acres of land!</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog4">
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 4</h1>
	<h2>Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>On the following day we returned to the nice mans farmland and started to hunt. We did the same strategy we did on day 2, but unfortunatly with little turnout.
	We only managed to shoot down about 5-10 birds because of the span of the feild.</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog5">
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 5</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>Hunting day 5 soon came and we needed a new way to hunt this massive land. We asked the landowners if any ideas or tips came to mind. They told us to send the dogs ahead without our presense, but within eye sight. The plan was a success with an outcome of 30-40 birds. </h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog6">
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 6</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>The next few days we tried new strategies. The first idea was to drive straight into the heart of the long grass and scare up the birds. The plan was fun and a little dangerous, but the outcome was beneficial. </h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog7">
	
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 7</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017 </h2>
	<h3>The next idea was to camp along the shorter praire grounds and try to spot any animal heads. At first the idea was a farce, but later on when sundown came the pheasants started to move. We encountered dozens of wild pheasent wandering for food and water. As they came close we sprung up and layed waste and came home with a good hunt. </h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog8">
	
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 8</h1>
	<h2> Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>After the last idea was been seen to be boring we redid the idea to send forward the dogs. With similar turnout as before we coninued to do the tatic for the remainder of the day.
	By the end of the day the dogs where to tired to move so we gave them a good meal and later sleepin.</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog9">
	
	<h1>Hunting day 9</h1>
	<h2>Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3>The next day after the smae tatic as yesterday the farmland takers wife invited us for dinner. When on arrival we noticed the house was older and the landowners decided not to refurbish. After a nice warm meal we thanked them and kindly gave the money for all their kindness.</h3>
	</div>
	<div id="blog10">
	
	<h1>Hunting Day 10</h1>
	<h2>Nheberer 2/27/2017</h2>
	<h3> On the last day after wake up and a quick go through of close land we decided to pack. On the way back home we stopped to say goodbye to the nice landowners that gave us new possibilites. Then afterwards we started the 10-20 hour drive back to Wisconsin from South Dakota with a good hunt and hungry belly's.
